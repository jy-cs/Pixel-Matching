# Camera Calibration
This project consists of two parts:
## Part I
We use the OpenCV library to write a calibration program that takes as input a list of 3D coordinates with their corresponding 2D pixel coordinates and outputs the 3x4 calibration matrix on the screen. In addition, our program should also print the average errors (difference between projected points and original pixels).

## Part II
We write our own program to calibrate an RGB camera using the SVD routine.
Our program takes as input a list of 3D coordinates with their corresponding 2D pixel coordinates and outputs the 3x4 calibration matrix on the screen. Similarly, the program also print the average errors (difference between projected points and original pixels).
